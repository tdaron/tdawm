  <strong>This projet has reached a stopping point as I move to Wayland for hidpi screens support :( </strong>

  <p align="center">
    This project is a <bold>X11</bold> Window Manager written in Rust.
    It's not meant to be the fastest, the lightest, the more extensible or whatever.
    I just wanted something simple that just works; I used to work with dwm but I wanted something
    I could better fit to my needs.
    <br />
    This project has simplicity in mind. I want the code to be clear and the end product a breath to use.

This project is made in Rust.
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is X11. You probably already have it otherwise you wouldn't be here i guess.

### Installation

There is no package distribution so at the moment you will have to clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/tdaron/tdawm

and then build it using cargo

    cargo build --release

The executable will be placed in `target/release/tdawm`.

Simply put it inside your .xinitrc and there you go !
